<h3>About the Correlations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the list of games to those with 1000 or more
ratings (need a lot of ratings to find enough overlap).</li>
<li>This was just 590 games.</li>
<li>Then I calculated the correlation between each of those games - the
values go from -1 to +1.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A high correlation isn't a recommendation per se; it just tells you
that there is a strong linear relationship between the games. For
example, if you like a game more than most other people then you will
probably like a highly correlated game more than most other people.
Note: if everyone believes that the correlated game sucks, you might agree,
but you'll likely believe it's not quite as bad as everyone else
says.
</p>

<p>
What's cool about the stat is that it really pops out the related
games. You'll see that the correlated games frequently have similar mechanics,
theme, and/or weight.
</p>

<p>
I just used the most basic correlation statistic (Pearson's
product-moment coefficient): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">Correlation on Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>
If you take a look at the wikipedia site, the pictures show exactly
what this is all about.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
The user names were scraped from the ratings pages of the top 100 games with Ruby (open-uri and
basic regular expressions).
</p>

<p>
The XML API client, and correlation calculations were written in Java (XPP and vanilla JDBC).

<p>
bgg.brokenmodel.com is in plain ol' php 4.0.
</p>

<p>
MySQL is used throughout.

<h3>Enjoy</h3>
<p>Cheers - Scott</p>
